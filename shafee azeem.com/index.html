                        to mitigate future seller impact, and reduced pending actions by 26%. Additionally, I developed
                        data-driven solutions to optimize case handling, increasing resolution rates by 18%, and
                        reducing seller wait times. I played a key role in knowledge transfers (KTs) and SOP
                        development, improving team efficiency and response accuracy, and contributed to a 22% increase
                        in productivity while reducing average case handling time (AHT) by 24%. I also managed
                        high-priority escalations, ensuring policy compliance and overall seller satisfaction, earning
                        the MVP award in 2023 for outstanding contributions. </p>
