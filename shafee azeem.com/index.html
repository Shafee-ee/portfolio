                <p>I'm Shafee, a frontend engineer with a strong eye for accessible, pixel-perfect interfaces and clean,
                    maintainable code. With around 9 years of total experience — including 3 years building real-world
                    frontend solutions for clients — I specialize in React and modern JavaScript. While frontend is my
                    core strength, I’m actively upskilling across the MERN stack by building full-stack projects like a
                    Spotify clone.

                    My 5 years at Amazon, though in a non-tech role, sharpened my communication skills, mentoring
                    ability, and business understanding from both seller and platform perspectives. A few years ago, I
                    made a conscious decision to return to tech, reigniting my passion for development. I'm now focused
                    on growing as an engineer and contributing to teams that value craft, clarity, and impact.
